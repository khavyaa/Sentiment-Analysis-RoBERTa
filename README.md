# Sentiment-Analysis-RoBERTa
Twitter sentiment analysis project leveraging the RoBERTa transformer model for text analysis.

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model and visualizes the results using a confusion matrix. The goal is to classify the sentiment (positive or racist/sexist) of tweets using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a valuable application of NLP, allowing us to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in textual data. RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) is a transformer-based model that excels in understanding the context and semantics of language, making it ideal for sentiment analysis tasks.

In this project, we leverage RoBERTa to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets. After training the model, we visualize its performance using a confusion matrix, which provides insights into the model's predictive accuracy.

## Key Features

- **RoBERTa Model:** Utilizes the RoBERTa transformer-based model for sentiment classification.
- **Confusion Matrix Visualization:** Demonstrates the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project:

- `transformers`: Python library for interfacing with pre-trained language models like RoBERTa.
- `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for model evaluation.

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Prepare your dataset of tweets or text data.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Fine-tune the RoBERTa model on your training dataset for sentiment analysis.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset.
   - Generate predictions and compute performance metrics.

4. **Confusion Matrix Visualization:**
   - Visualize the model's performance using a confusion matrix.

## Results

The project aims to achieve accurate sentiment classification using RoBERTa and visualize the model's performance through a confusion matrix. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of RoBERTa in sentiment analysis tasks.
